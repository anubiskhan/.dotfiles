# Development Guidelines

## Docker Image Selection Principles
1. **Base Image Priority**
   - Use official Alpine-based images when possible
   - Prefer images that already contain primary dependencies
   - Choose slim/minimal variants when available

2. **Dependency Management**
   - Start with the most feature-complete base image for primary function
   - Use `--no-cache` flags for package managers
   - Combine RUN commands to reduce layers
   - Clean up package manager caches in same layer

3. **Image Optimization**
   - Minimize image size
   - Reduce number of layers
   - Remove unnecessary files
   - Use multi-stage builds when appropriate

## Package Selection Criteria
1. **Stability**
   - Use stable, well-maintained packages
   - Pin versions for reproducible builds
   - Document version decisions

2. **Minimalism**
   - Avoid unnecessary dependencies
   - Use `--no-install-recommends` or equivalent
   - Question each additional package
